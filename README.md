# Bodylight.js FMU Compiler
[![stability-beta](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-beta-33bbff.svg)](https://github.com/mkenney/software-guides/blob/master/STABILITY-BADGES.md#beta)

This repository contains scripts and configuration facilitating compilation of FMU file (with source codes in C of compiled Modelica model and solver) to Javascript with embedded WebAssembly. 
Such compiled javascript allows to access model simulation via FMI API v 2.0 as specified in FMI standard.

* FMU co-simulation mode with source codes and CVODE solver generated by Dymola is fully supported.
* FMU co-simulation mode with source codes and Euler solver generated by OpenModelica is supported.
* FMU co-simulation mode with source codes and CVODE solver generated by OpenModelica is supported.

This repository also contains basic HTML and Python script as CGI script to support compilation as web service on Linux platform with (EMSDK, GlibC,...).

To use Bodylight.js-FMU-Compiler, choose one of these options:
1. compiler in virtual machine - Vagrant tool and VirtualBox is needed - see [Bodylight-Virtualmachine](https://github.com/creative-connections/Bodylight-VirtualMachine)
2. compiler in local environment - needs to install EMSDK,GLIBC and PYTHON3 manually
3. compiler in docker - needs docker to be installed in environment.

You may follow our tutorial at https://bodylight.physiome.cz/Bodylight-docs/tutorial/

## 1. Manual compiler 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/creative-connections/Bodylight.js-FMU-Compiler
cd Bodylight.js-FMU-Compiler
cd manual_compiler
```
If you have docker in your environment, then just
```bash
./om_compile_docker.sh my_model.fmu my_model
```
IF you don't have docker, but have emsdk installed, activated and configured, then
```bash
./om_compile_native.sh my_model.fmu my_model
```
Use the resulting my_model.zip with JS to create Web simulator using bodylight.js 

## 2. Compiler in Virtual Machine with upload/compiler web service
(Recommended)
Install Bodylight-VirtualMachine using `vagrant` tool and VirtualBox. Instruction at https://github.com/creative-connections/Bodylight-VirtualMachine 
The compiler web service is available at http://localhost:8080/compiler

## 3. Compiler in Local Environmnet with upload/compiler web service
(on your own risk)
Be sure that EMSDK, GLIBC 2.18, Python 3 and CMake are installed e.g.
- https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git
- https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/glibc/glibc-2.18.tar.gz
- Python3 - use your system installer: e.g. `yum install python3` or `apt install python3` or install Miniconda or Anaconda environment (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
- CMake - use your system installer: e.g. `yum install cmake` or `apt install cmake`

Bodylight.js-FMU-Compiler contains `index.html` and `save-file.py` to support compilation via simple web interface. Make the root of Bodylight.js-FMU-Compiler accessible for Apache web server, and the simple web form can be used.
E.g.
```
Alias "/compiler" "/home/vagrant/Bodylight.js-FMU-Compiler/"
<Directory "/home/vagrant/Bodylight.js-FMU-Compiler">
  Options +ExecCGI
  AddHandler cgi-script .py
  Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
  Require all granted
  Options +Indexes +FollowSymLinks +IncludesNOEXEC
  IndexOptions FancyIndexing HTMLTable NameWidth=*
  AllowOverride All
</Directory> 
```

Allow access to input and output subdirectories of `Bodylight.js-FMU-Compiler`.
```
chmod ugo+rwx input output
```

## 4. Compiler in Docker Container
This is maintained due to lack of contributors. 
This option uses docker container with all required software to run this compiler in any platform, uses older emsdk image.

### Windows instructions

1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

2. Download this repository and open PowerShell in the top directory

If you decide to clone this repository, take care to disable automatic line ending conversion in git.

3. Build the docker image
```powershell
docker build -t bodylight.js.fmu.compiler .
```
This builds the Dockerfile as bodylight.js.fmu.compiler.

#### Usage
Put a `name.fmu` file into the `input` directory and run the following command in PowerShell inside the directory. Taking care to replace name.fmu at the end of the command with the name of your `.fmu` file.

```powershell
docker run --rm --mount "type=bind,source=$(Get-Location)\input,target=/input" --mount "type=bind,source=$(Get-Location)\output,target=/output" bodylight.js.fmu.compiler:latest bash worker.sh name.fmu
```

After the compilation finishes, `input/name.fmu` is deleted and the resulting `name.js` file is copied to `output`. Along with the compilation log `name.log`.


### Linux instructions

1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

2. Clone this repository and cd inside

3. Build the docker image
```bash
docker build -t bodylight.js.fmu.compiler "$(pwd)"
```
This builds the Dockerfile as bodylight.js.fmu.compiler. You might need to run this command with root privileges.


#### Automatic compilation
#### Starting the compiler
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name bodylight.js.fmu.compiler \
  --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/input,target=/input \
  --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/output,target=/output \
  --rm bodylight.js.fmu.compiler:latest bash worker.sh
```
This starts the docker container and binds the `input` and `output` directories.

#### Stopping the compiler
```bash
docker stop bodylight.js.fmu.compiler
```

#### Usage
Put `name.fmu` files into the `input` directory. After the compilation finishes,
`input/name.fmu` is deleted and the resulting `name.js` file is copied to
`output`. Along with the compilation log `name.log`.

Files are processed sequentially in alphabetical order.

In case of error, only the compilation log will be present in the output directory.


#### Manual compilation
Put a `name.fmu` file into the `input` directory and run the following command inside the directory. Taking care to replace name.fmu at the end of the command with the name of your `.fmu` file.

```bash
docker run \
  --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/input,target=/input \
  --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/output,target=/output \
  --rm bodylight.js.fmu.compiler:latest bash worker.sh name.fmu
```

After the compilation finishes, `input/name.fmu` is deleted and the resulting `name.js` file is copied to `output`. Along with the compilation log `name.log`.

The simple and medium size models compile into Javascript with size 0.5 MB - 2 MB. The embedded [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) is supported by 4 major web browsers (Firefox,Chrome,Ms Edge,Safari). The simulation is nearly native speed (1.5x or 2x slower). One drawback can be memory limit on some mobile devices, which may prevent to run some of the most complex model (see Buddy above) there.
