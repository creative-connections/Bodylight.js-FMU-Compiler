# Bodylight.js FMU Compiler
[![stability-beta](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-beta-33bbff.svg)](https://github.com/mkenney/software-guides/blob/master/STABILITY-BADGES.md#beta)

This repository contains scripts and configuration facilitating compilation of FMU file (with source codes in C of compiled Modelica model and solver) to Javascript with embedded WebAssembly. 
Such compiled javascript allows to access model simulation via FMI API v 2.0 as specified in FMI standard.

* FMU co-simulation mode with source codes and CVODE solver generated by Dymola is fully supported.
* FMU co-simulation mode with source codes and CVODE solver generated by OpenModelica is supported.

To use Bodylight.js-FMU-Compiler, choose one of these options:
1. compiler in docker - needs docker to be installed in environment.

For legacy - older options are available:
2. compiler in virtual machine - Vagrant tool and VirtualBox is needed - see [Bodylight-Virtualmachine](https://github.com/creative-connections/Bodylight-VirtualMachine)
3. compiler in local environment - needs to install EMSDK,GLIBC and PYTHON3 manually

You may follow our tutorial at https://bodylight.physiome.cz/Bodylight-docs/tutorial/

## 1. Manual compiler (default, updated 12/2025)
Requirements:
* Docker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/creative-connections/Bodylight.js-FMU-Compiler
cd Bodylight.js-FMU-Compiler
```
For Modelica models in OpenModelica, in OMEdit, export model as FMU 2.0 in co-simulation with CVODE solver, with source code and with `--fmiFlags=s:cvode` set in Tools->Options->Simulation->Additional Translation flags
For Modelica models in Dymola, export model as FMU 2.0 in co-simulation with source code and CVODE solver:

With the resulting `my_model.fmu` launch script in Linux
```bash
./compile_docker.sh my_model.fmu
```

or in Windows powershell
```bash
./compile_docker.ps1 my_model.fmu
```

Use option `-o` to enable compilation optimization, producing smaller and faster code (using `-O3 --clossure 1`), by default it is disabled.
Use option `-w` to write resulting WASM embedded in JS into FMU/binaries/wasm32, by default it is disabled.
Use option `-s` to generate sample web simulator into index.html, it is in resulting ZIP file

The script compiles FMU to WebAssembly and embeds them into Javascript creates ZIP file with JS and XML with model description. Use it with dbs-webcomponents or bodylight.js web components.

If `-s` is used, sample index.html is created and further web app development can be made using web components. The JS is compatible with dbs-webcomponents as well as bodylight.js web components.

* [2021 - Bodylight.js web components](https://bodylight.physiome.cz/)

## 2. Compiler in Virtual Machine with upload/compiler web service (deprecated)

For legacy options, see `legacy\README.md`.

# Examples

The following models were converted to web-based simulators using FMU compiler.
* [Hemodynamics](https://egolem.online/demo/#hemo2.md) - model of hemodynamics of cardiovascular system with simulated volume,presure during cardiac cycle

The simple and medium size models compile into Javascript with size 0.5 MB - 2 MB. The embedded [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) is supported by 4 major web browsers (Firefox,Chrome,Ms Edge,Safari). The simulation is nearly native speed (1.5x or 2x slower). One drawback can be memory limit on some mobile devices, which may prevent to run some of the most complex model (see Buddy above) there.
